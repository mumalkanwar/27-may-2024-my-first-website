    <p>An Indian climber rescued from Everest has died in hospital, a Nepali tourism official said Tuesday, taking the number of fatalities this season on the world's highest mountain to eight.</p>
    <p>Banshi Lal, 46, was plucked from the mountain last week and taken to a hospital in Nepal's capital Kathmandu.</p>
    <p>"He died at the hospital yesterday," Rakesh Gurung of the tourism department told AFP.

        Three people -- a British climber and two Nepali guides -- among the eight are listed as missing but presumed dead.
        
        The latest fatality comes as the Everest mountaineering season nears its end, with the death toll relatively low compared to other years.</p>

    <p>Last year was the deadliest season on the mountain with 18 fatalities.

        Three more died climbing other Nepali peaks including a Romanian aiming for Lhotse, which neighbours Everest, while a French and a Nepali climber died on Makalu, the world's fifth-highest mountain.
        
        Nepal is home to eight of the world's 10 highest peaks and welcomes hundreds of adventurers each spring, when temperatures are warm and winds typically calm</p>
